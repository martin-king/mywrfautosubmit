# mywrfautosubmit

Martin King, Created 19 Oct 2016.

Collected here are scripts I use to run chained jobs on Hexagon. At the moment, there is no documentation or much comment, if you can't figure out what I am doing, please ask me.

I would appreciate improvement, modification, or correction to be communicated back to me. Preferably through Github, if not to me directly through email or something.
