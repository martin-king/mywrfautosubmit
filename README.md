# mywrfautosubmit

Martin King, Created 19 Oct 2016.

Collected here are Python scripts I use to run chained jobs on Hexagon. PBS scripts which are called by these Python scripts to run geogrid, ungrib, metgrid, real, and wrf are not included here. At the moment, there is no documentation or many comments, if you can't figure out what I am doing, please ask me.

I would appreciate improvement, modification, or correction to be communicated back to me. Preferably through Github, if not then to me directly through email or something.
